# About me
My name is data (i also go by kinex).

I like coding and under that umbrella i like game dev, engine dev and lang dev, those are my hobbies.

I code mostly in C# but i also code in luau (I love embedding luau into engines and stuff) and cpp, i like language development and i've actually made an lang called [meow](https://github.com/KinexDev/Meow) completely from scratch, i like making game engines too (i only made 2 though currently)

check out [luau-snake](https://github.com/KinexDev/Luau-Snake), a snake game written in my own standalone luau runtime called luna.
